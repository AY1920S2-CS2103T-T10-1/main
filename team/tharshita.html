<p><strong>HealthyBaby</strong> (HYBB) is a desktop application targeted towards university students that provides users with a database of quick, easy, and healthy recipes.
HYBB helps alleviate the challenges faced while maintaining healthy eating habits, easing the transition from eating
out everyday to cooking healthy meals regularly. The user interacts with HYBB using a Command Line Interface, and it has a Graphical User Interface created with JavaFX.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This portfolio serves to demonstrate my proficiency in the various aspects of software engineering such as
coding, project management and technical writing skills in crafting documentation that fits the target user.
My role was to design and implement the code for the goals feature and switch feature which will be further elaborated in the
following sections. Also included are the details of the relevant documentation I have written in the user and
developer guide to assist users and other developers to understand these features.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: added <strong>the goals feature</strong>
I implemented the commands and functionality related to the goals feature.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: Auto generated goals for a recipe every time a recipe&#8217;s ingredients are added or edited. Based on these goals,
when recipe is marked as cooked, an archive of past cooked meals can be seen as well as a pie chart representing the goals distribution
can be seen under the goals tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user using a healthy recipe database would want to see
their history of cooked meals as well as statistics of their food distribution (represented by the goals distribution).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement affects existing add and edit commands and commands to be added in future such as planning.
It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives so as to achieve the most accurate results.
The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands as well as working on all parts of the code such as
creating a new json file to store records, working with ui and fxml and listeners with pie charts. A great deal of designing and
abstraction was needed where code had to be continually changed and rewritten to be optimised and make proper use of inheritance
of ingredients for efficiency in calculating quantity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: added <strong>the ability to switch between tabs</strong>
I implemented the switch command that allows for switching between tabs. A great deal of planning and understanding
of the front-end code was needed in order to integrate the switch command. I designed and abstracted out the front end into
4 main tabs.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main functionalities and commands associated with the entire goals feature are <code>add</code>, <code>addIngredient</code>, <code>edit</code>, <code>editIngredient</code>,
 <code>cooked</code>, <code>listGoals</code> and 'removeGoals'. Goals are auto-generated and added to a recipe every time <code>add</code>, <code>addIngredient</code>, <code>edit</code> or <code>editIngredient</code> is executed.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="details-of-implementation-auto-generation-of-goals"><a class="link" href="#details-of-implementation-auto-generation-of-goals">Details of Implementation (Auto-generation of goals)</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sequence diagram shows how goals are generated through the example of <code>addIngredient</code> command execution</p>
</div>

<div class="title">Figure 2. Reference Frame for Add command sequence diagram</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A recipe is initially created with an empty goals set from parser and <code>calculateGoals()</code> is then called in the <code>AddCommand</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each ingredient type that is associated with a goal (<code>Vegetable</code>, <code>Protein</code>, <code>Fruit</code>, <code>Grain</code>) is listed as an enum type
in MainIngredientType. This ensures that invalid goals are not created and simplifies the mapping between <code>MainIngredientType</code>
and <code>Goal</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The calculation of goals then occurs through looping through each ingredient type and executing the method call to
<code>Recipe#calculateIngredientQuantity()</code>.
This would obtain the total quantity for each ingredient, firstly by calling <code>Ingredient#getMainIngredientType()</code>
to ensure the validity of ingredients beings calculated (e.g. any instance of 'Other' ingredient would throw an <code>InvalidStateException</code>).
Secondly, by obtaining the quantity in grams through the method calls to <code>Ingredient#getQuantity()' and 'Quantity#convertToGram()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the calculation for each main ingredient type is completed, an instance of <code>MainIngredientTypeMagnitude</code> is created.
It acts as a container to store the quantities and conduct the checks for whether these quantities meet the minimum quantity
requirement for their respective food group. This calculation and checks are done through the method call to
<code>MainIngredientTypeMagnitude#getMainTypes()</code> which would then return a set of <code>MainIngredientType</code> that successfully met the
minimum requirement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lastly, after looping through this set and creating each goal with the mapping from <code>MainIngredientType</code> to <code>Goal</code> done
(e.g. <code>MainIngredientType.FRUIT</code> leads to the creation of goal with goal name generated as "Fruity Fiesta"), the goals will
be updated in the particular instance of <code>Recipe r</code> and <code>Model#addRecipe(r)</code> would then update <code>RecipeBook</code> in storage.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 3. Activity diagram when a cooked command is entered</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After <code>CookedCommand#execute(model)</code> is called, the series of checks shown in the above diagram is done to determine
if the recipe can be marked as cooked. With multiple recipes inputted (eg <code>cooked</code> 1 2 3, the series of checks will
loop through for for each recipe.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The checks ensure that all the recipes inputted are valid, else the  <code>CookedCommand</code>
throws an exception and terminates. If successful, a new  <code>Record</code> containing the <code>Name</code>, current <code>Date</code> and set of <code>Goals</code>
associated with the recipe is created and <code>Model#addRecord(record)</code> would then update <code>CookedRecordBook</code> in storage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, if the recipe marked as cooked was included in the Planned Recipes for the day,
it will be removed from the planned list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With reference to the structure of the CookedRecords Model,</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 4. Class diagram of Record</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can see above that once a record is added to the UniqueRecordList two Observable lists will be updated for each
addition of <code>Record</code>. Firstly, it is the <code>internalRecordsList</code> that stores unique <code>Record</code>. Secondly, based on this list,
an <code>internalGoalsTally</code> that stores <code>GoalCount</code> will be updated each time. This <code>GoalCount</code> consists of one of the four main goal
and its respective tally and this observable list is what the pie chart will be listening to for updates and will change
each time the <code>internalGoalsTally</code> has been updated as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hence the <code>cooked</code> command is essential in not only archiving data, but also giving the user personalised statistics
on their overall goal distribution that resembles the Healthy Eating Plate. The immutability of each object is
supported to ensure the correctness of undo and redo functionality as well.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> System generates tags for each recipe based on food algorithm.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Higher accuracy and makes use of inputs of ingredients class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Would require several criteria checks that may not be intuitive and would require the use of artificial intelligence for the highest accuracy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2 :</strong> User chooses from 4 given goals and user adds the tags to the recipes.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Easy to implement. User can filter their preferred goals easily.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternative 1 was chosen as standardising the goals give the recipes more meaning, especially when we are able
to calculate statistics and present in in an meaningful and appealing way for users when it models the Healthy eating Plate.
Furthermore, custom goals would not have checks would not have been implemented. for users to filter preferred recipes,
the command <code>favourite</code> as been implemented.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: More accurate and can be modelled against ideal ratio of a healthy meal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Harder to implement as we need to standardise the ingredient measurements, not as intuitive.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>

<li>
<p>Pros: More consistent for the user in keeping track of their goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Harder to implement as repetitive checks are needed every time ingredients are added or modified.
Will be more expensive to calculate with a larger database.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative 2 :</strong> Calculate the goals for each recipe every time it is retrieved from storage and set in RecipeList.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Easier to implement as only one check is needed for when the recipes are set.</p>

<p>Alternative 1 was chosen as it optimizes the functions and uses of a Record and the scale for a personal data

the association between GoalCount and Record makes the tally process more efficient.</p>
