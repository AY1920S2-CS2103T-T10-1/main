== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `RecipeListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `RecipeBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a recipe).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed git back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores a `RecipeBook` object that stores all recipes.
* stores a `PlannedBook` object that stores all plans.
* stores a `CookedRecordBook` object that stores the records of all the cooked recipes.
* stores a `QuoteBook` object that stores all quotes.
* exposes four unmodifiable lists that can be 'observed' +
1. `ObservableList<Recipe>`
2. `ObservableList<Plan>`
3. `ObservableList<Record>`
4. `ObservableList<Quote>` +
e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

In the figure above, we can see that we are maintaining 5 different storages. These storages aim to keep the memory of:

* `UserPrefs`
* `RecipeBook`
* `PlannedBook`
* `CookedRecords`
* `QuoteBook`

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the HYBB data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.recipe.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::basic[]
=== Basic commands


==== Switch command

image::SwitchActivityDiagram.png[]

==== List command


==== Find command


==== Add command


==== Edit command
The edit feature allows users to edit the properties of a Recipe with ease using the `edit` command. +

This feature is facilitated by the `EditCommand` class. +

The following activity diagram illustrates how the `EditCommand` is used. +

.Activity Diagram for edit command
image::EditActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Implementation
This section explains how the `edit` command is implemented.

1. User specified arguments are passed to the `EditCommandParser` and passed into `ArgumentTokenizer` and
`ArgumentMultimap`.

2. The arguments will then be parsed by `ParserUtil` and passed into `EditRecipeDescriptor`.
An error will be thrown if the inputs were invalid or if no properties of the Recipe were edited.

3. A new `EditCommand` object will be created containing the new properties of the `Recipe`.

4. `EditCommand#execute()` will then get the latest list of recipes from `Model` and obtain the `Recipe` that is
being edited.

5. This `Recipe` is passed into `EditCommand#createEditedRecipe()` which creates a new `Recipe` with the edited properties.

6. `Model#setRecipe()` will then replace the `Recipe` being edited with the new `Recipe` and update the list of recipes and plans.

The following sequence diagram summarizes the steps taken so far:

.Edit sequence diagram
image::EditSequenceDiagram.png[]

The edited recipe will be updated in both the list of recipes and plans.
The following section explains in detail the implementation behind how each list is updated in the
`RecipeBook` and `PlannedBook` class.

1. Continuing off from Step 8, `ModelManager#setRecipe()` will be called to replace the target `Recipe` with the
edited `Recipe`. (`ModelManager` implements `Model`)

2. These arguments will then be passed into `RecipeBook#setRecipe()` and `UniqueRecipeList#setRecipe()`

2.


The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `Recipe` is updated and how each `Plan`
that uses this `Recipe` is updated.


.Edit sequence diagram focusing on Model
image::EditModelSequenceDiagram.png[]


==== Delete command


==== Favourite and Unfavourite commands (Brian)
Description: TODO

===== Implementation
For brevity, we will only be talking about the `favourite` command here. Note that the `unfavourite` command is
implemented in the same way.

1. The user input received by `FavouriteCommandParser#parse` will pass on the user input to
`ParserUtil#parseMultipleIndex` to verify if the indexes keyed in are non-zero, unsigned integers. An error is thrown
if any of the indexes do not meet this requirement.
+
On top of verifying the validity of the indexes, `ParserUtil#parseMultipleIndex` will remove any duplicate indexes
and sort them. It returns a sorted array of one-based indexes.

2. A new `FavouriteCommand` object will be created with the array of indexes and returned to the `LogicManager`.

3. The `FavouriteCommand#execute` method is executed. First, the array of indexes will be checked against the
_currently displayed recipe list_ to ensure that there exists a corresponding recipe index. An error will be thrown if
a user specified recipe index is out of bounds.

4. Next, we check if the specified recipe(s) is already a favourite. If it is not a favourite yet, we use an
`EditRecipeDescriptor` to set the recipe's `isFavourite` to true.

5. Finally, we display the names of the recipes that have been newly made favourites, and the names of the recipes that
were already favourites.

Here is a sample sequence diagram that shows what happens when the user inputs `favourite 2 3`:

.Favourite command sequence diagram
image::FavouriteCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

This operation favourites recipe 2 and 3.

==== Undo and Redo commands (Brian)
The implementation of `undo` and `redo` was adapted from AB3. However, HYBB requires more book-keeping because on top
of the `RecipeBook`, we have a `PlannedBook` and a `CookedRecordBook` to keep track of as well.

For brevity, we will only be talking about the `undo` command here. Note that the `redo` command is implemented in the
same way.

===== Implementation (before `undo` is called)
1. Whenever a command that changes the state of any of the books is called, `Model#commitBook` is
called as well.
+
`Model#commitBook` will save the `CommandType` and `Tab` of the command in 2 separate stacks in
`MultipleBookStateManager`. It will also save the current state of the affected book(s) in an ArrayList of that book
type. All redundant states, regardless of which book it belongs to, will be purged before any saving occurs.
+
Note: `CommandType` tells you which book(s) the command affects, while `Tab` tells you which tab should be
displayed upon execution of the command.

===== Implementation (when `undo` is called)
1. `Model#canUndo` is called to check if there are sufficient actions to be undone. An error is thrown if there are
insufficient actions to be undone.

2. If able to undo, `Model#undoBook` is called. The `CommandType` stack is popped to know which book(s) need undoing.
The corresponding books in `Model` are then set to the previous version.

The following sequence diagram shows what happens when the user calls an undo operation:

.Undo command sequence diagram
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[]

Result: TODO

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: How undo and redo executes
Challenges faced: TODO

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire recipe book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May use up a lot of memory space within a single session 1) if there is a large number of recipe book commits
and/or 2) if the magnitude of a single commit is large (ie. the database is huge, containing many recipes).

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory.
** Cons: Tedious to ensure the correctness of the implementation of each individual command. Furthermore, some commands
affect multiple books, making book-keeping even more complicated (and hence, susceptible to error).

==== Clear command


==== Exit command


// end::basic[]

// tag::recipecustomisation[]
=== Recipe customisation commands (Brian)
The following commands: `addingredient`, `editingredient`, `deleteingredient`, `addstep`, `editstep`, and `deletestep`
were implemented to overcome the limitations of the `edit` command. These recipe customisation commands allow the user to make targeted changes to the ingredient or step fields instead of having to rewrite the
entire field using `edit`.

==== Implementation
TODO

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: TODO
TODO

// end::recipecustomisation[]

// tag::advancedfilter[]
=== Filter command (Brian)
The advanced filter feature uses the `filter` command to search for recipes according to the set of keywords provided
by the user. Think of it as a greatly enhanced and more robust version of the `find` command, which only allows the
user to find recipes by their name.

==== Implementation
This section explains how the `filter` command is implemented.

1. User specified keywords are directed to `FilterCommandParser#parse` where `ArgumentTokenizer` and
`ArgumentMultimap` are used to parse the user input. An error will be thrown if no keywords are specified at all.

2. The parsed user input is then fed into `RecipeMatchesKeywordPredicate` where a `Predicate`, p, is created. This
predicate will subsequently be used as the filter to get all recipes that meet the user specified criteria.

3. A new `FilterCommand` object will be created with the predicate and returned to the `LogicManager`.

4. The `FilterCommand#execute` method is executed and `Model#updateFilteredRecipeList` is called. This tests
every recipe in the database against the predicate, p, and updates the filtered recipe list with recipes that meet the
user specified criteria.

5. Once complete, this filtered recipe list is displayed to the user.

Here is a sample sequence diagram that shows what happens when the user inputs `filter favourites t/20 ig/Pasta`:

.Advanced filter sequence diagram
image::AdvancedFilterSequenceDiagram.png[]

This operation displays all recipes that 1) are marked as favourites, 2) take 20 minutes or less to prepare,
and 3) contains pasta as an ingredient.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Consistency of user input format
One concern we had while implementing this feature was the sheer number of commands and prefixes that our app had.
Eventually, the current implementation was chosen because we didn't want to define a new format for `filter`
keywords which might potentially confuse our users.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the existing prefixes and format in the user input.
** Pros: The existing `ArgumentTokenizer` and `ArgumentMultimap` classes already have capabilities to parse user input
that is in a certain format. Thus, using the same format saves us time and effort in implementing our own parser. It
also spares the user from having to remember multiple formats / keywords.
** Cons: The user has to be familiar with the prefixes and other special keywords in order to use this feature to its
fullest potential.

* **Alternative 2:** Define new keywords that the user can use. These keywords could be "more english-like" as opposed
to using shortened tags as prefixes.
** Pros: Easy to remember these keywords since they are more english-like.
** Cons: We must implement our own parser which is tedious. The user will also have to remember a new set of keywords
on top of the existing prefixes. This is double work for the user.
// end::advancedfilter[]

// tag::planning[]
=== Planning feature (Beatrice)
==== Implementation
The planning feature uses the `UniquePlannedList` to store and display all plans and the `PlannedRecipeMap` to
navigate between recipes and plans.

The `UniquePlannedList` provides the UI with an unmodifiable observable list that can be 'observed' and displayed.
Meanwhile, the `PlannedRecipeMap` maintains a mapping from `Recipe` to `Plan` so that a `Plan` can be easily
updated when a `Recipe` is changed.

Given below is a sequence diagram on how a `Plan` is updated when a `Recipe` is changed.

image::abc.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How recipes are scheduled

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Scheduled recipes are saved in a separate data structure.
** Pros: Scheduled recipes can be easily obtained and sorted.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage if a large number of recipes are scheduled.

* **Alternative 2:** Store the date that the scheduled recipe is scheduled on as another attribute to the Recipe class.
** Pros: Easy to implement, no additional data structure added.
** Cons: All scheduled recipes can not be easily seen and sorted.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the scheduled recipes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a tree map to store the scheduled recipes in a <Date, List<Recipe>> key-value pair.
** Pros: Allows us to easily and intuitively access the list of recipes scheduled on a certain day.
** Cons: Obtaining all the recipes scheduled across a period of time will not be very efficient.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a List sorted by increasing time.
** Pros: Easy to implement, uncomplicated data structure.
** Cons: Hard to obtain the scheduled recipes on a certain date, as we do not know which index
corresponds to the date we are interested in.
// end::planning[]

// tag::goals[]
=== Goals feature
The main functionalities and commands associated with the entire goals feature are `add`, `addIngredient`, `edit`, `editIngredient`,
 `cooked`, `listGoals` and 'removeGoals'. Goals are auto-generated and added to a recipe every time `add`, `addIngredient`, `edit` or `editIngredient` is executed.

The following sequence diagram shows how goals are generated through the example of `addIngredient` command execution

.Add command sequence diagram
image::AddSequenceDiagram.png[]
image::AddRefSequenceDiagram.png[]

A recipe is initially created with an empty goals set from parser and `calculateGoals()` is then called in the `AddCommand`.

Each ingredient type that is associated with a goal (`Vegetable`, `Protein`, `Fruit`, `Grain`) is listed as an enum type
in MainIngredientType. This ensures that invalid goals are not created and simplifies the mapping between `MainIngredientType`
and `Goal`.

The calculation of goals then occurs through looping through each ingredient type and executing the method call to
`Recipe#calculateIngredientQuantity()`.
This would obtain the total quantity for each ingredient, firstly by calling `Ingredient#getMainIngredientType()`
to ensure the validity of ingredients beings calculated (e.g. any instance of 'Other' ingredient would throw an `InvalidStateException`).
Secondly, by obtaining the quantity in grams through the method calls to `Ingredient#getQuantity()' and 'Quantity#convertToGram()`.

After the calculation for each main ingredient type is completed, an instance of `MainIngredientTypeMagnitude' is created.
It acts as a container to store the quantities and conduct the checks for whether these quantities meet the minimum quantity
requirement for their respective food group. This calculation and checks are done through the method call to
`MainIngredientTypeMagnitude#getMainTypes() which would then return a set of `MainIngredientType` that successfully met the
minimum requirement.

Lastly, after looping through this set and creating each goal with the mapping from `MainIngredientType` to `Goal` done
(e.g. MainIngredientType.FRUIT leads to the creation of goal with goal name generated as "Fruity Fiesta"), the goals will
be updated in the particular instance of `Recipe r` and `Model#addRecipe(r)` would then update `RecipeBook` in storage.

The immutability of each object is supported to ensure the correctness of undo and redo functionality.

==== Proposed Implementation

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How goals are being tagged

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** System generates tags for each recipe based on food algorithm.
** Pros: Higher accuracy and makes use of inputs of ingredients class.
** Cons: Would require several criteria checks that may not be intuitive and would require the use of artificial intelligence for the highest accuracy.

* **Alternative 2 :** User chooses from 4 given goals and user adds the tags to the recipes.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Is dependant on user's understanding and not universal understanding of what may be deemed healthy.

===== Aspect: How to determine the criteria for each goal

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Check by quantity
** Pros: More accurate and can be modelled against ideal ratio of a healthy meal.
** Cons: Harder to implement as we need to standardise the ingredient measurements, not as intuitive.

* **Alternative 2 :** Check by variety
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Not as accurate as one grain of rice would still be counted as variety.
// end::goals[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
